    <h1>Guides</h1>
    <p>
        Skyblock is a huge game so from time to time you just don't know where or how to advance.
        <br />This website is here to organize and explain how you should advance threw out all the stages of the game.
        <br />        Each guide will be devided to a couple of parts. All guides will have how to progress in your skills and how to gain money. They will suggest which armour, tools, pets and misc. are best to use for each activity.
        <br />Note that some guides will miss a part or two and that is because no differnce should or could be made from the latest progress.
        <br />To start just pick from the bar above where you're at the game's progression and click.
